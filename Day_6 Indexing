Objective
Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1 , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example

s=abcdef
Print abc def

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

Constraints
1<=T<=10
Output Format

For each String  (where ), print 's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.

Explanation

Test Case 0: 






The even indices are , , and , and the odd indices are , , and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().

Test Case 1: 




The even indices are  and , and the odd indices are  and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
T=int(input())
for i in range(0,T):
    S=str(input())
    N=len(S)
    final_even_word=""
    final_odd_word=""
    for number in range(N):
        if number == 0 or number % 2 == 0:
            new_even_letter=S[number]
            final_even_word = final_even_word + new_even_letter
        else:
            new_odd_letter = S[number]
            final_odd_word= final_odd_word+new_odd_letter
    print(final_even_word + " " + final_odd_word)
